Important upgrade notes
=======================

If you upgrade ``ftw.contentpage`` to 1.6 or greater. The IOrgUnitMarker interface does not
longer exists. The marker Interfaces is replaced with the IAuthority interface.

NEW: By manually ticking the "Mark content for listings" checkbox on the ContentPage.
Run the ``ftw.contentpage`` upgrades steps and your site will be fine.


Usage
=====

**Types:**

- ContentPage: Folderish type for the site structure. Contains the blocks
- AddressBlock: AddressBlock contains address informations and it ``uses ftw.geo`` to render a map
- ListingBlock: A folderish block, which lists files and images by default. Two block views are provided: Tabular listing and a gallery view. The columns of the file listing are configurable per block. The default set of columns is configured through the the registry (plone.app.registry). The default sort order of the Listingblock file listing can be configured per block.
- EventPage / EventFolder: A simple and minimal event implementation based on a ContentPage.
- News / NewsFolder: A simple news implementation based on a ContentPage.

**Special views:**

There's a two-column and two-level overview named ``authorities_view``, which displays a list of ContentPages with with the ``IAuthority`` interface.
The ``IAuthority`` interface ist added and removed by ticking a checkbox called "Mark content for listings" on the ContentPage. This allows to decide if a ContentPage is displayed on the
``authorities_view`` manually. The checkbox is implemented with archetypes.schemaextender, which
allows to extend other content types:

Code example:

::

  <class class="dotted.name.to.my.class">
    <implements interface="ftw.contentpage.interfaces.IAuthoritySupport" />
  </class>

The Checkbox is protected with the permission: ``ftw.contentpage: Toggle IAuthority marker interface.``


The EventFolder has a simple events listing, which shows the next 10 upcoming events (batching included).

The NewsFolder has a simple news listing, which shows the 10 most recent news entries (batching included).

**ContentListing viewlet:**

The content listing viewlet is registered for all ContentPages.
It shows categorized subcontent, within the ContentPage
The categorization is done by a schemaextended field, so it's also possible to categorize your own or any other content.

Code example:

::

  <class class="dotted.name.to.my.class">
    <implements interface="ftw.contentpage.interfaces.ICategorizable" />
  </class>


** Teaser Image **
All content pages, event pages and news are able to display a teaser image, which is stored
on the content itself. It behaves like a regular block and shows also the description.
The teaser image related fields have their own write permission, one per content type.
Take a look at the `rolemap.xml` for details.

** Portlet **
It's possible to enable an archive portlet for News and EventPages.
It only works if the current view is the news or event listing view.
The portlet is not created by default.


``ftw.contentpage`` is using the additional slot provided by simplelayout
(implements the IAdditionalListingEnabled interface of simplelayout)

So the layout has the following structure:

1. Simplelayout main slot for blocks
2. The content listing viewlet
3. The additional slot for blocks

This way it's possible to display content below the content listing viewlet (by drag'n'drop)
