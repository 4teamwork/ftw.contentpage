1.5 (2013-09-26)
----------------

- Fix bug in addressblock-maps if diazo is activated.
  Each map has it's own id, generated with the id of the addressblock.
  Diazo uses the same id for anchor links.
  The openlayers js is searching for the map id and finds the link instead the
  map and breaks in a 'TypeError: Cannot read property 'w' of null' error.'
  The fix adds a prefix to the map-id to be sure, we don't get duplicated ids on
  a page.
  [elioschmutz]

  [jone]

- Add document date to listing block if ftw.file is installed.
  [jone]

- Fix extend_query_by_date function if 'datestring' contains a  bad date-format.
  The function is to extend a query (dict) with a daterange and returns the new
  query. If the function can't convert the datestring to a datetime object, it
  returns None and the given query is lost.
  Now the function returns the untouched query.
